					<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					<p class="lead">
								Our mission is to produce informed responsible, contributing members of society. In order to do this, we offer a safe and structured learning environment that fosters a positive self-concept and perpetuates self-motivation and high academic achievement.
					</p>
					<h2>Values</h2>

					<p>Student learning is the chief priority of Butler Traditional High School. Students learn at their own pace and level.
										A safe, secure, and physically comfortable environment is essential to student learning.
										Each student is a valued individual with unique physical, social, emotional, and intellectual needs.
										Curriculum and instructional practices will incorporate a variety of learning activities with high expectations.
										All students will be prepared to successfully transition into the real world.
										Morality, patriotism, citizenship, and character will be emphasized in a structured learning environment.
										Each student will be provided with avenues which promote aesthetic growth through creative thinking and creative expression.
										Teachers, administrators, parents, students, and the communities share the responsibility for each student's educational growth.
							</p>
							<h2>Purpose</h2>

							<p>	The traditional program provides a structured and time-tested educational climate for those students who perform best with such an environment. Because of an expressed need by a segment of our community, traditional schools promote established educational goals, develop and incorporate resources traditional to the attainment of those goals, and maintain a staff dedicated to rigorous academic, moral, and physical expectations. Within this framework, the traditional program stresses the following:

										Mastery of skills for each grade level, including an emphasis in listening, reading penmanship, grammar usage, composition, spelling, and mathematics.
										Study and understanding of history, government, geography, literature, economics, sciences, foreign languages (7-12), and fine arts.
										Development and extension of logical reasoning, inquiry, and analysis.
										Homework assigned on a regular basis to reinforce and enhance classroom learning.
										Frequent contact and communication between school and home.
										Physical development in personal health, physical fitness, and recreational and competitive sports in middle and high schools.
										Traditional concepts of patriotism, courtesy, moral values, individual rights, and respect for authority.
										Clearly established codes of conduct, dress, and rules of operation.
										</p>
