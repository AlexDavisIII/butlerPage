This is the Butler Traditional High School website rebuilt from the ground up with the Foundation framework in mind (primarily for the grid system).

The Butler Home Page is used to display contact information to you as well as a few things that may be interesting for you to see (Parent Portal and InkSpot). The first section is set up to encourage you to check out the about page or even the faculty part of the site!
